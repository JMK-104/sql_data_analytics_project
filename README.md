# SQL Data Analytics Project

This project demonstrates how to leverage SQL for data-driven insights. It is structured into two phases that guide the analytics journey, from initial exploration to more advanced business-oriented analysis.

---

## üìå Project Phases

### 1. Exploratory Analysis  
In this phase, we focus on understanding the dataset:
- Examining the structure of the data.  
- Performing basic descriptive statistics.  
- Identifying trends, anomalies, and distributions.  

The goal is to generate **preliminary insights** that inform further deep-dive analysis.

---

### 2. Advanced Analytics  
Here, we move beyond exploration to extract **business-ready insights**:  
- Applying complex SQL queries.  
- Building aggregated views and performance metrics.  
- Delivering actionable insights for decision-making.  

---

## üìä Reports

The project generates two main reports:  

- **`product_report.sql`** ‚Üí Analyzes product-level data, performance trends, and key KPIs.  
- **`customer_report.sql`** ‚Üí Provides insights into customer behavior, segmentation, and retention metrics.  

These scripts can be executed directly in your SQL environment to produce analytical outputs.
